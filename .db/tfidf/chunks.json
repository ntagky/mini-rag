Content and Structure (1)\n- Q1: Some in the pharmaceutical industry have expressed concern that the ICH E3 guidance, Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3), is intended as a requirement (i.e., a template that must be followed).  The fact that the ICH M4 guidance for the Common Technical Document (CTD) refers to specific structural elements described in ICH E3 (e.g., Clinical Study Report (CSR) section headings) may have contributed to this interpretation.  Interpretation of ICH E3 as a rigid template\n1 This guidance was developed within the Efficacy Implementation Working Group of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH process.  The Q&As in this document have been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, June 2012.  At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and the United States.\n2 Arabic numbers reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, June 2012.",

This is a particular problem when ICH E3 is used for studies for which it was not designed (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies or studies with health economic or quality of life outcomes). Can ICH reaffirm that ICH E3 is a guidance and not a required template and that ICH E3 can be adapted to report studies that fall outside the original scope of ICH E3?\n- A1: Yes.  ICH E3 is a guidance, not a set of rigid requirements or a template, and flexibility is inherent in its use.  'The [guidance] is intended to assist sponsors in the development of a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well organized, and easy to review.' Modifications and adaptations to the structure presented in the guidance that lead to better display and communication of information are encouraged.",

Some data in the appendices are specific requirements of individual regulatory authorities and should be submitted as appropriate.  The numbering should then be adapted accordingly.'\nTo illustrate this flexibility, consider demographic baseline information.  ICH E3 suggests presentation of this information in the efficacy evaluation, but many variations of this presentation are possible.  For example, if the efficacy and safety populations differ substantially, it would be appropriate to present demographic and baseline characteristics for the safety and efficacy populations in the safety and efficacy sections or in a new section preceding the efficacy and safety results sections.",

Nevertheless, the basic principles described can be applied to other kinds of trials, such as clinical pharmacology studies and open-label safety studies, recognizing that not all sections or data presentations may be appropriate or important for these other types of trials.  Sponsors are encouraged to adapt the recommendations in the guidance as appropriate (e.g., by deleting sections that are not relevant or adding important sections that are not mentioned in the guidance).\n- Q2: The ICH E3 guidance provides limited guidance on the synopsis.  In the ICH M4E guidance, additional guidance on the synopsis of a CSR is given, including its use as a stand-alone document and its length.  Although ICH E3 asks for a usual maximum length of 3 pages, ICH M4E extends this page limit for more complex and important studies (e.g., to 10 pages).  How should both guidances be read together?",

Because the synopsis will be used as a stand-alone document within a Common Technical Document, it should be written so that it can be understood and interpreted on its own (i.e., without the other sections of a CSR).  In addition to a brief description of the study design and critical methodological information, the synopsis should provide efficacy and safety results, as well as other critical information, including data on the study population, disposition of subjects, important protocol deviations, and treatment compliance.  Crossreferences to other sections of the CSR should be avoided.  As explained in ICH M4E, complex or large and important studies may call for a synopsis longer than three pages. The 10-page example given in M4E is not an absolute requirement or limit but should not need to be exceeded greatly.  The use of a tabular format for the synopsis is not mandatory.",

The example provided for section 14.3.1, however, does not try to illustrate all possibilities, but shows individuals with adverse events by body system, severity, and perceived drug-relatedness for treatment group 'X.'  Listings should also display investigator's verbatim terms for each event and could be used to show demographic or disease-specific information, dosage, duration of treatment, or treatment cycle (for cancer chemotherapy).\nBecause it can be impractical to display all of this information in a single listing, such analyses can be presented in individual listings (e.g., by dose or other subgroup of interest).  When adverse event data are presented by subgroup, however, a display of overall adverse events should also be included.  For example, for a drug for subjects with chronic kidney disease, adverse events could be tabulated separately for subjects receiving or not receiving dialysis, but a table that includes adverse events in all subjects should also be included.",

However, the flowchart in Annex IVa of ICH E3 (Disposition of Patients) recommends that data be provided on the number of subjects withdrawn from the study because of 'protocol violations.'  Neither the term 'protocol deviations' nor 'protocol violations' has been previously defined by ICH.

For example, important protocol deviations might include enrolling subjects in violation of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a specific subject population or failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as this may compromise the scientific value of the trial.\nProtocol violation and important protocol deviation are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to a significant departure from protocol requirements.  The word violation can also have other meanings in a regulatory context.  However, in Annex IVa of the ICH E3\nguidance (Disposition of Patients), the term protocol violation was intended to mean only a change, divergence, or departure from the study requirements, whether by the subject or investigator, that resulted in a subject's withdrawal from study participation. (Whether such subjects should be included in the study analysis is a separate question.)",

General Scheme and Purpose of Guidance (1.1)\nThis guidance first describes the purpose of the control group and the types of control groups commonly employed to demonstrate efficacy. It then discusses the critical design and interpretation issues associated with the use of an active control trial to demonstrate efficacy by showing non-inferiority or equivalence to the control (Section 1.5).  There are circumstances in which a finding of non-inferiority cannot be interpreted as evidence of efficacy.  Specifically, for a finding of non-inferiority to be interpreted as showing efficacy, the trial needs to have had the ability to distinguish effective from less effective or ineffective treatments.\nThe guidance then describes trials using each kind of control group in more detail (see sections 2.0-2.5.7) and considers, for each:\n- Its ability to minimize bias\n- Ethical and practical issues associated with its use\n- Its usefulness and the quality of inference in particular situations\n- Modifications of study design or combinations with other controls that can resolve ethical, practical, or inferential concerns\n- Its overall advantages and disadvantages\nSeveral other ICH guidances are particularly relevant to this guidance:",

For example, one could assume that pain would have persisted for a defined time, blood pressure would not have changed, depression would have lasted for a defined time, tumors would have progressed, or the mortality after an acute infarction would have been the same as previously seen.  In unusual cases, the course of illness is in fact predictable in a defined population and it may be possible to use a similar group of patients previously studied as a historical control (see section 1.3.5).  In most situations, however, a concurrent control group is needed because it is not possible to predict outcome with adequate accuracy or certainty.",

Failure to achieve this similarity can introduce a bias into the study.  Bias here (and as used in ICH E9) means the systematic tendency of any aspects of the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of the results of clinical trials to make the estimate of a treatment effect deviate from its true value.  Randomization and blinding are the two techniques usually used to minimize the chance of such bias and to ensure that the test treatment and control groups are similar at the start of the study and are treated similarly in the course of the study (see ICH E9).

The principal methods of determining who will be in the control group are by randomization or by selection of a control population separate from the population treated in the trial (external or historical control).  This document categorizes control groups into five types.  The first four are concurrently controlled (the control group and test groups are chosen from the same population and treated concurrently), usually with random assignment to treatment; they are distinguished by the type of control treatment (listed above) used. External (historical) control groups, regardless of the comparator treatment, are considered together as the fifth type because of serious concerns about the ability of such trials to ensure comparability of test and control groups and their ability to minimize important biases, making this design usable only in unusual circumstances.",

In that case, the question of whether the trial could have shown such a difference if there had been one is critical (see section 1.5).\nThe use of a placebo control group does not imply that the control group is untreated.

Because of the advantages of double-blind designs, this design is likely to be needed and suitable only when it is difficult or impossible to double-blind (e.g., treatments with easily recognized toxicity) and only when there is reasonable confidence that study endpoints are objective and that the results of the trial are unlikely to be influenced by the factors listed in section 1.2.2.  Note that it is often possible to have a blinded evaluator carry out endpoint assessment, even if the overall trial is not double-blind.

They may also be used with the primary objective of comparing the efficacy and/or safety of the two treatments (see section 1.4).

This similarity establishes the efficacy of the test treatment, however, only if it can be assumed that the active control was effective under the conditions of the trial, as two treatments would also look similar if neither were effective in the trial (see section 1.5).\nClinical trials designed to demonstrate efficacy of a new drug by showing that it is similar in efficacy to a standard agent have been called equivalence trials.

If a trial intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing superiority of a test treatment to control lacks assay sensitivity, it will fail to show that the test treatment is superior and will fail to lead to a conclusion of efficacy.  In contrast, if a trial is intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing a test treatment to be noninferior to an active control, but lacks assay sensitivity, the trial may find an ineffective treatment to be non-inferior and could lead to an erroneous conclusion of efficacy.\nWhen two treatments within a trial are shown to have different efficacy (i.e., when one treatment is superior), that finding itself demonstrates that the trial had assay sensitivity.

Appropriate Trial Conduct (1.5.1.2)\nClinical researchers and trial sponsors intend to perform high-quality trials, and the availability of the Good Clinical Practices guidance (ICH E6) will continue to enhance trial quality. Nonetheless, it should be appreciated that in trials intended to show a difference between treatments there is a strong imperative to use a good trial design and minimize trial errors because many trial imperfections increase the likelihood of failing to show a difference between treatments when one exists.  In placebo-controlled trials many efforts are made to improve compliance and increase the likelihood that the patient population will be responsive to drug effects to ensure that an effective treatment will be distinguished from placebo.  Nonetheless, in many clinical settings, despite the strong stimulus and extensive efforts to ensure trial excellence and assay sensitivity, clinical trials are often unable to reliably distinguish effective drugs from placebo.",

The kinds of trial error that diminish observed differences between treatments (e.g., poor compliance, high placebo response, certain concomitant treatment, misclassification of outcomes) are of particular concern with respect to preservation of assay sensitivity.  However, when it is believed that the new drug is actually superior to the control, there will be a strong stimulus to conduct a high quality trial so that the non-inferiority margin is more likely to be excluded.  It should also be noted that some kinds of trial errors can increase variance, which would decrease the likelihood of showing non-inferiority by widening the confidence interval, so that a difference between treatment and control greater than the margin could not be excluded.  There would therefore be a strong stimulus in non-inferiority trials to reduce such sources of variance as poor measurement technique.",

In particular, it should be determined whether any observed differences in the populations enrolled, the use of concomitant therapies, compliance with therapy, and the extent of, and reasons for, dropping out could adversely affect assay sensitivity.  Even when the design and conduct of a trial appear to have been quite similar to those of the trials providing the basis for determining the non-inferiority margin, outcomes with the active control treatment that are visibly atypical (e.g., cure rate in an antibiotic trial that is unusually high or low) can indicate that important differences existed.",

Assay Sensitivity in Trials Intended to Demonstrate Superiority (1.5.2)\nThe question of assay sensitivity, although particularly critical in non-inferiority trials, actually arises in any trial that fails to detect a difference between treatments, including a placebo-controlled trial and a dose-response trial. If a treatment fails to show superiority to placebo, for example, it means either that the treatment was ineffective or that the study as designed and conducted was not capable of distinguishing an effective treatment from placebo.\nA useful approach to the assessment of assay sensitivity in active control trials and in placebocontrolled trials is the three-arm trial , including both placebo and a known active treatment, a trial design with several advantages.  Such a trial measures effect size (test drug versus placebo) and allows comparison of test drug and active control in a setting where assay sensitivity is established by the active control versus placebo comparison.

A placebo is a dummy treatment that appears as identical as possible to the test treatment with respect to physical characteristics such as color, weight, taste and smell, but that does not contain the test drug.  Some trials may study more than one dose of the test treatment or include both an active control and placebo.  In these cases, it may be easier for the investigator to use more than one placebo ( double-dummy ) than to try to make all treatments look the same. The use of placebo facilitates, and is almost always accompanied by, double-blinding (or double-masking). The difference in outcome between the active treatment and placebo groups is the measure of treatment effect under the conditions of the trial.  Within this general description there are a wide variety of designs that can be used successfully: Parallel or crossover designs (see ICH E9), single fixed dose or titration in the active drug group, several fixed doses.

Such trials, however, even if ethical, may pose important practical problems.  For example, deferred treatment of pain or other symptoms may be unacceptable to patients or physicians and they may not want to participate in a trial that requires this.  Whether a particular placebo controlled trial of a new agent will be acceptable to subjects and investigators when there is known effective therapy is a matter of investigator, patient, and institutional review board (IRB)/ independent ethics committee (IEC) judgment, and acceptability may differ among ICH regions.

Randomized Withdrawal (2.1.5.2.4)\nAs with the early-escape design, careful attention should be paid to procedures for monitoring patients and assessing study endpoints to ensure that patients failing on an assigned treatment are identified rapidly.\nThe randomized withdrawal approach is useful in several situations.  First, it may be suitable for drugs that appear to resolve an episode of recurring illness (e.g., antidepressants), in which case the withdrawal study is, in effect, a relapse-prevention study.  Second, it may be used for drugs that suppress a symptom or sign (chronic pain, hypertension, and angina), but where a long-term placebo-controlled trial would be difficult; in this case, the study can establish long-term efficacy. Third, the design is particularly useful in determining how long a therapy should be continued (e.g., post-infarction treatments with a beta-blocker).\nThe general advantage of randomized withdrawal designs, when used with an early-escape endpoint, such as return of symptoms, is that the period of placebo exposure with poor response that a patient would have to undergo is short.",

Note that the randomized withdrawal design could be used to assess dose-response\nafter an initial placebo-controlled titration study (See ICH E4). The titration study is an efficient design for establishing effectiveness, but does not give good dose-response information in many cases.

It is also important to realize that treatment effects observed in these trials may be larger than those seen in an unselected population because randomized withdrawal studies are enriched with responders and exclude people who cannot tolerate the drug.  This phenomenon results when the trial explicitly includes only subjects who appear to have responded to the drug or includes only people who have completed a previous phase of study (which is often an indicator of a good response and always indicates ability to tolerate the drug).

Ethical concerns may also direct studies toward less ill subjects or toward examination of short-term endpoints when long-term outcomes are of greater interest.  Where a placebocontrolled trial is unethical and an active control trial would not be credible, it may be very difficult to study new drugs at all.  For example, it would not be considered ethical to carry out a placebo-controlled trial of a thrombolytic agent in patients with acute myocardial infarction.  Yet it would be difficult in the current environment to establish a valid non-inferiority margin based on historical data because of the emergence of acute revascularization procedures that might alter the size of the benefits of the thrombolytics.

The first use is considered in ICH E4; the use to demonstrate efficacy is the subject of this guidance. Evidence of efficacy could be based on significant differences in pair-wise comparisons between dosage groups or between dosage groups and placebo, or on evidence of a significant positive trend with increasing dose, even if no two groups are significantly different.  In the latter case, however, further study may be needed to assess the effectiveness of the low doses.  As noted in ICH E9, the particular approach for the primary efficacy analysis should be prespecified.\nStudies in which the treatment groups vary in regimen raise many of the same considerations as dose-response trials.

Second, the placebo group permits an estimate of the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment,\nalthough the estimate may not be very precise if the dosing groups are relatively small.  Third, as the drug-placebo difference is generally larger than inter-dose differences, use of placebo may permit smaller sample sizes.  The size of various dose groups need not be identical; e.g., larger samples could be used to give more precise information about the effect of smaller doses or be used to increase the power of the study to show a clear effect of what is expected to be the optimal dose.

Ethical Issues (2.4.3)\nActive control trials are generally considered to pose fewer ethical and practical problems than placebo-controlled trials because all subjects receive active treatment.  It should be appreciated, however, that subjects receiving a new treatment are not receiving standard therapy (just as a placebo control group is not) and may be receiving an ineffective or harmful drug.  This is an important matter if the active control therapy is known to improve survival or decrease the occurrence of irreversible morbidity, i.e. conditions in which a placebo or no treatment control would be unacceptable.  There should therefore be a sound rationale for the test treatment.  If there is no strong reason to expect the new drug to be at least as good as the standard, an add-on study (see section 2.1.5.2.1) may be more appropriate, if the conditions allow such a design.",

Usually, the control group is a well-documented population of patients observed at an earlier time (historical control), but it could be a group at another institution observed contemporaneously, or even a group at the same institution but outside the study.  An external control study could be a superiority study (e.g. comparison with an untreated group) or a non-inferiority study.

Rather, changes from baseline are compared with an estimate of what would have happened to the patients in the absence of treatment with the test drug. Both baseline-controlled trials and trials that use a more complicated sequential on-offon (drug, placebo, drug) design, but that do not include a concurrently randomized control group, are of this type.  As noted, in these trials the observed changes from baseline or between study periods are always compared, at least implicitly, to some estimate of what would have happened without the intervention.  Such estimates are generally made on the basis of general knowledge, without reference to a specific control population.  Although in some cases this is plainly reasonable, e.g., when the effect is dramatic, occurs rapidly following treatment, and is unlikely to have occurred spontaneously (e.g., general anesthesia, cardioversion, measurable tumor shrinkage), in most cases it is not so obvious and a specific historical experience should be sought.",

Blinding and randomization are not available to minimize bias when external controls are used.  It is well documented that untreated historicalcontrol groups tend to have worse outcomes than an apparently similarly chosen control group in a randomized study, possibly reflecting a selection bias.  Control groups in a randomized study need to meet certain criteria to be entered into the study, criteria that are generally more stringent and identify a less sick population than is typical of external control groups.  An external control group is often identified retrospectively, leading to potential bias in its selection.

Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment.  Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires. 10\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24, 11 (see section III.A.1, 'Exceptions to Informed Consent'), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21\n9 In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n10 See 21 CFR 50.20.",

Description of Clinical Investigation\nFDA recommends that when discussing the required elements of informed consent with prospective subjects, there should first be a discussion of the care a patient would likely receive if not part of the research, if relevant, and then the potential subject should be provided with information about the research.  This sequence allows prospective subjects to understand how the research differs from the care they might otherwise receive.  The description of the clinical investigation should identify tests or procedures required by the protocol that would not be part of their care outside of the research; for example, drawing blood samples for a pharmacokinetic study.  Note that all experimental procedures must be identified as such (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)).  Procedures related solely to research must be explained (for example, protocol-driven versus individualized dosing, randomized assignment to treatment, blinding of subject and investigator, and receipt of placebo if the study is placebo-controlled) (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)).  In some cases, tests or procedures that would be considered part of usual clinical care will not be performed on study participants; when applicable, this should be discussed as part of the informed consent process.",

For example, when withdrawal from a clinical investigation may adversely affect the subject, the informed consent process must explain the withdrawal procedures that are recommended in order to ensure the subject's safety and should specifically state why the withdrawal procedures are important to the subject's welfare.  For some clinical investigations, an intervention should be withdrawn gradually, or the investigator may recommend follow-up to ensure the subject's safety when an investigational intervention is prematurely terminated due to a subject's withdrawal.  In these cases, the consent process must explicitly inform the subject of the potential adverse effects of premature termination of the investigational intervention.

Considerations that may help address these challenges and provide additional safeguards include:",

The key point to consider when determining who may serve as an LAR is that the LAR must be authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of the prospective subject to the procedure(s) involved in the clinical investigation.\nIn the United States, the legal authority for who may serve as an LAR is determined by State and local law.  Where applicable law exists to determine who is authorized to serve as an LAR to consent to an individual's participation in research, consent must be obtained from an LAR in accordance with this law. Institutions, IRBs, and investigators should have the ability to access information regarding applicable laws for the clinical investigations they conduct or oversee, when necessary.

In such situations, consent to research by an LAR is an acceptable alternative under FDA's regulations.

Electronic processes to obtain informed consent may use an interactive interface for the informed consent process, which may facilitate the subject's ability to retain and comprehend the information.  Furthermore, these electronic processes may also promote timely entry of any electronic informed consent into a study database and facilitate collection of the subject's informed consent from remote locations.

Enrollment in more than one clinical investigation could increase risks to subjects, particularly because they may be exposed to more than one investigational product for which the safety profile may not be well understood, and there may be potential drug or device interactions.  Also, subjects may find it difficult to understand the risks and potential benefits or meet the demands of multiple protocols.  FDA generally discourages enrollment in multiple investigations, although there are some circumstances in which co-enrollment may be appropriate (e.g., rare disease studies that are evaluating different aspects of the condition and involvement in one study does not affect the other study).  In addition, this recommendation does not apply to certain appropriately designed studies, such as a clinical investigation of a novel drug and a companion in vitro diagnostic device that is essential for the safe and effective use of the drug.\n82 Please see footnote 80.",

Investigators and sponsors can describe other plans in the consent form for informing subjects of the outcomes of the clinical investigation.\nFDA regulations do not directly address the issue of IRB review of return of aggregated results to subjects; however, when return of aggregated results is planned at the time of initial IRB review of the study, or the decision to share results is made after initial IRB approval but while the study is still open with the IRB, then the plan for communicating this information to subjects should be reviewed by the IRB.  However, if the plan to share aggregated study results is developed after the study is closed with the IRB, the IRB does not need to review the sponsor's plan to share the aggregate results. 90",

Is informed consent required to review patient records?\nSponsors and investigators may seek to review patient medical records for a variety of reasons related to a clinical investigation.  Whether the record review is considered part of the clinical investigation, as defined under FDA's regulations at 21 CFR 50.3(c) and 21 CFR 56.102(c), is determined by the IRB on a case-by-case basis.  If the record review is part of the clinical investigation, then informed consent from the subject for the record review is required under 21 CFR part 50.\nA survey of patient records at a site may be performed to determine whether the site has a sufficient number of patients with the condition of interest for the clinical investigation to be feasible.  Such a survey is in preparation for a clinical investigation and does not fall within the definition of a clinical investigation and, therefore, does not require informed consent under FDA's regulations.

When this occurs, the IRB should determine whether currently enrolled subjects should be provided with the new information and given an opportunity to affirm their willingness to continue in the research.  In the research community this process is frequently referred to as 'reconsent.' FDA regulations do not use or define the term reconsent, nor do FDA regulations specify the process an IRB should use to determine the need or method to inform subjects who are already enrolled in the study of the new information.
